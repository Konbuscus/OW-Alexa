# Contributing to the Jovo Framework

Thanks a lot for considering to contribute to Jovo ‚ù§Ô∏èüîä

Jovo is an open source framework that makes it easier for developers to build cross-platform voice apps. 
Here is a very short set of guidelines to help you make Jovo better. Looking forward to your pull requests!

## Your First Contribution

We're looking for any kinds of contributions. If you need any inspiration, here are some things that might be interesting:
* Add integrations like Analytics and Databases
* Add platform specific features that haven't been added yet
* Propose new voice platforms

You can also take a look at our [Feature Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/urZzYHuI/jovo-framework-roadmap).

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
